# simulate-fresh-merge.sh
#
# Simulates a fresh merge of the current PR branch with the latest base branch.
# This ensures CI checks run against the actual merge result, not a stale merge preview.
#
# Usage:
#   BASE_REF=main bash scripts/simulate-fresh-merge.sh
#
# Environment variables:
#   BASE_REF  The base branch to merge with (e.g. "main"). Required.
#
# Exit code 0 = merge succeeded or not needed; non-zero = merge conflict detected.
#
# See docs/case-studies/issue-23 for why this is critical.
